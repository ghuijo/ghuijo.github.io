Hello!I'm a researcher designing geometry-aware deep neural networks for computer vision and image generation.

I am currently affiliated with the Industry-Academic Cooperation Foundation, Ewha Womans University, in Seoul, Korea.

Before joining ICF-Ewha, I completed my M.S. in Artificial Intelligence Convergence (Medical AI & CV Lab, advised by Prof. Jang-Hwan Choi) and my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering at Ewha Womans University in 2024 and 2022, respectively.

My research interests include computer vision, generative modeling, and efficient inference, with applications spanning 3D perception, human-centered AI and robotics.

I also have experience in human pose recognition, medical image analysis, and protein-protein interaction prediction.

For more details, please refer to my [CV](../assets/pdf/CV_Geonhui_JO_Oct_2025.pdf).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
